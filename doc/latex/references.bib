	abstract = {Data mining algorithms are facing the challenge to deal with an increasing number of complex objects. For graph data, a whole toolbox of data mining algorithms becomes available by defining a kernel function on instances of graphs. Graph kernels based on walks, subtrees and cycles in graphs have been proposed so far. As a general problem, these kernels are either computationally expensive or limited in their expressiveness. We try to overcome this problem by defining expressive graph kernels which are based on paths. As the computation of all paths and longest paths in a graph is NP-hard, we propose graph kernels based on shortest paths. These kernels are computable in polynomial time, retain expressivity and are still positive definite. In experiments on classification of graph models of proteins, our shortest-path kernels show significantly higher classification accuracy than walk-based kernels.},

	abstract = {In numerous domains it is useful to represent a single example by the set of the local features or parts that comprise it. However, this representation poses a challenge to many conventional machine learning techniques, since sets may vary in cardinality and elements lack a meaningful ordering. Kernel methods can learn complex functions, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences---generally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function called the pyramid match that measures partial match similarity in time linear in the number of features. The pyramid match maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in order to find implicit correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. We show the pyramid match yields a Mercer kernel, and we prove bounds on its error relative to the optimal partial matching cost. We demonstrate our algorithm on both classification and regression tasks, including object recognition, 3-D human pose inference, and time of publication estimation for documents, and we show that the proposed method is accurate and significantly more efficient than current approaches.},

	abstract = {High throughput screening determines the effects of many conditions on a given biological target. Currently, to estimate the effects of those conditions on other targets requires either strong modeling assumptions (e.g. similarities among targets) or separate screens. Ideally, data-driven experimentation could be used to learn accurate models for many conditions and targets without doing all possible experiments. We have previously described an active machine learning algorithm that can iteratively choose small sets of experiments to learn models of multiple effects. We now show that, with no prior knowledge and with liquid handling robotics and automated microscopy under its control, this learner accurately learned the effects of 48 chemical compounds on the subcellular localization of 48 proteins while performing only 29\% of all possible experiments. The results represent the first practical demonstration of the utility of active learning-driven biological experimentation in which the set of possible phenotypes is unknown in advance.},

	abstract = {In recent era prediction of enzyme class from an unknown protein is one of the challenging tasks in bioinformatics. Day to day the number of proteins is increases as result the prediction of enzyme class gives a new opportunity to bioinformatics scholars. The prime objective of this article is to implement the machine learning classification technique for feature selection and predictions also find out an appropriate classification technique for function prediction. In this article the seven different classification technique like CRT, QUEST, CHAID, C5.0, ANN (Artificial Neural Network), SVM and Bayesian has been implemented on 4368 protein data that has been extracted from UniprotKB databank and categories into six different class. The proteins data is high dimensional sequence data and contain a maximum of 48 features.To manipulate the high dimensional sequential protein data with different classification technique, the SPSS has been used as an experimental tool. Different classification techniques give different results for every model and shows that the data are imbalanced for class C4, C5 and C6. The imbalanced data affect the performance of model. In these three classes the precision and recall value is very less or negligible. The experimental results highlight that the C5.0 classification technique accuracy is more suited for protein feature classification and predictions. The C5.0 classification technique gives 95.56\% accuracy and also gives high precision and recall value. Finally, we conclude that the features that is selected can be used for function prediction.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Despite advances in high-throughput methods for discovering protein-protein interactions, the interaction networks of even well-studied model organisms are sketchy at best, highlighting the continued need for computational methods to help direct experimentalists in the search for novel interactions.
RESULTS: We present a kernel method for predicting protein-protein interactions using a combination of data sources, including protein sequences, Gene Ontology annotations, local properties of the network, and homologous interactions in other species. Whereas protein kernels proposed in the literature provide a similarity between single proteins, prediction of interactions requires a kernel between pairs of proteins. We propose a pairwise kernel that converts a kernel between single proteins into a kernel between pairs of proteins, and we illustrate the kernel's effectiveness in conjunction with a support vector machine classifier. Furthermore, we obtain improved performance by combining several sequence-based kernels based on k-mer frequency, motif and domain content and by further augmenting the pairwise sequence kernel with features that are based on other sources of data. We apply our method to predict physical interactions in yeast using data from the BIND database. At a false positive rate of 1\% the classifier retrieves close to 80\% of a set of trusted interactions. We thus demonstrate the ability of our method to make accurate predictions despite the sizeable fraction of false positives that are known to exist in interaction databases.
AVAILABILITY: The classification experiments were performed using PyML available at http://pyml.sourceforge.net. Data are available at: http://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/sppi.},

During the past 20 years, the considerable research activity that occurred in the field resulted in the development of dozens of graph kernels, each focusing on specific structural properties of graphs. Graph kernels have proven successful in a wide range of domains, ranging from social networks to bioinformatics. The goal of this survey is to provide a unifying view of the literature on graph kernels. In particular, we present a comprehensive overview of a wide range of graph kernels. Furthermore, we perform an experimental evaluation of several of those kernels on publicly available datasets, and provide a comparative study. Finally, we discuss key applications of graph kernels, and outline some challenges that remain to be addressed.},
